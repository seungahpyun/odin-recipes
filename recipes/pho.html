    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pho (pronounced <i>“fuh”</i>) is a Vietnamese noodle soup that’s made with broth, rice noodles, meat, and fresh garnishes.  Authentic versions take much more time and love than this recipe. But if you're looking for a quick version with similar warm, fresh and comforting qualities, this is what I make my family at home!</p>
