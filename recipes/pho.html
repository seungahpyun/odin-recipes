    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pho (pronounced <i>“fuh”</i>) is a Vietnamese noodle soup that’s made with broth, rice noodles, meat, and fresh garnishes.  Authentic versions take much more time and love than this recipe. But if you're looking for a quick version with similar warm, fresh and comforting qualities, this is what I make my family at home!</p>

    <h4><b>Ingredients</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8 oz dried rice vermicelli noodles</li>
      <li>Desired meat: chicken, pork, steak or raw shrimp</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion , quartered</li>
      <li>2 (2-inch pieces) fresh ginger , unpeeled and halved, length-wise</li>
      <li>6 cups broth (chicken, beef or vegetable, depending on protein choice)</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 whole clove (optional)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons fish sauce (or less, to taste preference)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red chili paste (sambal oelek)</li>
      <li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Instructions</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a large dry pot over medium heat add the onion halves and ginger pieces. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>Add the broth, water, coriander, clove, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, chili garlic paste, cinnamon stick and a pinch of fresh cracked salt and pepper to the pot. Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare noodles according to package instructions. Once soft, drain, rinse and set aside.</li>
      <li>Ready the garnishes in individual small bowls for serving: cilantro, basil, green onions, bean sprouts, lime wedges and sliced chilies.</li>
      <li>1-5 minutes before the broth is done cooking, add desired meat to the broth to cook, just until done (2-3 minutes for raw, thinly sliced chicken or pork, 1-2 minutes for shrimp or thinly sliced steak).</li>
      <li>Discard the ginger, clove, cinnamon stick and onion pieces from the pot.</li>
      <li>Divide the noodles among bowls; ladle broth on top (and meat). Add desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
