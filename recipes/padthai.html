    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><b>Pad Thai</b> is stir-fry dish made with rice noodles, shrimp, chicken, or tofu, peanuts, a scrambled egg and bean sprouts.<br>
      The ingredients are sauteed together in a wok and tossed in a delicious Pad Thai sauce.<br>
      It's a common street food in Thailand and one of the most popular menu items at Thai restaurants around the country.</p>
    <p><i>To make vegan or vegetarian pad Thai, leave out the egg and substitute the fish sauce for more soy sauce.</i></p>

    <h4><b>Ingredients</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic , minced</li>
      <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper , thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 green onions , chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts</li>
      <li>2 limes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Fresh cilantro , chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Instructions</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Cook noodles</b> according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
      <li><b>Make sauce</b>by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside</li>
      <li><b>Stir Fry::</b>Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
      <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
      <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
      <li><b>Garnish</b> the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
      <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
    </ol>
